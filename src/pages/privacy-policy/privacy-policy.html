    By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of the web site, which is set out below. This document privacy policy
    tells you how we collect and manage your personal information. Whenever we collect, handle, store, use or disclose personal
    information that you provide to us when using this site or via e-mail, we comply with the requirements contained in the
    Privacy Act 1988, including the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

  <h2>Collecting and Using Personal Information</h2>

  <p>Personal information is any information (whether fact, opinion or evaluative material) about you as an individual, from
    which your identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained. This includes your name, address, telephone number,
    email address and profession or occupation. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably
    identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information. We will not sell, license, transmit or
    disclose this information outside of Ozhome Group and its affiliated companies unless (a) expressly authorized by you,
    (b) necessary to enable Ozhome Group contractors or agents to perform certain functions for us, or (c) required or permitted
    by law. In all cases, we will disclose the information consistent with applicable laws and regulations and we will require
    the recipient to protect the information and use it only for the purpose it was provided. We only collect personal information
    about you for the purpose of delivering and improving the site and the services we provide and to enhance and develop
    our relationship with you, as well as personalising our offering and establishing accounts. Generally, those services
    relate to advertising real estate and businesses, and any other services such as finance, conveyancing, property maintenance
    and any other related real estate service.</p>

  <h2>Information from other web sites</h2>

  <p>We may institute programs with advertising partners and other web sites in which they share information with us. To make
    this advertising more relevant to you, anonymous information about the previous web browsing activity of your computer
    on sites within ​our affiliates' network is collected and used to associate your computer with one or more pre-defined
    interest categories. Advertising that matches those interest categories may then be served to your computer. This interest
    based advertising does not change the amount of advertising you receive, it just makes it more relevant. We may ask advertisers
    to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them. This data sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,”
    helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see. We may receive
    information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness
    of those ads.</p>

    contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with
    our rights or property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, we may disclose personal
    information when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure. We may engage third parties to provide you
    with goods or services on our behalf. In that circumstance, we may disclose your personal information to those third
    parties in order to meet your request for goods or services. We are not responsible for the use or disclosure by others
    of the information you provide to our site.</p>
